## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### 1. **Dynamic Routing in Next.js**
- **Problem:** Dynamic routing for individual doctor profiles (`/doctor/[id]`) threw errors with data fetching.
- **Solution:** Used `generateStaticParams` and client-side fetching with fallback loaders.

### 2. **Backend API Integration**
- **Problem:** Delays in fetching data with SSR/ISR.
- **Solution:** Used `useEffect` for fetching in client components, fallback states for loading, and separated API calls into a `utils/api.ts` file.

### 3. **Email Sending via Nodemailer**
- **Problem:** Gmail SMTP blocked by default security settings.
- **Solution:** Created a separate Gmail app password and tested email delivery with logs.

### 4. **Form Validations**
- **Problem:** Some form submissions were failing silently.
- **Solution:** Added required fields, character limits, and toast-based feedback.

### 5. **Responsive UI**
- **Problem:** Table and grid layouts broke on smaller screens.
- **Solution:** Used Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities to adjust layout and spacing dynamically.
